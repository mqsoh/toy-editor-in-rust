This is a toy text editor that I wrote in Rust, following Gary Bernhardt's Text
Editor From Scratch screencast on Destroy All Software.

Ctrl-q quits.

To navigate:

    Up: Ctrl-k
    Down: Ctrl-j
    Left: Ctrl-h
    Right: Ctrl-l

You can also undo with Ctrl-u.

You can type any ASCII character and backspace works, but nothing else, really.
The screencast has limited (but amazing!) goals. Also, the lack of unicode is
because, in Ruby, he just does a sort of `getch` that supports Unicode but I
couldn't figure out how to do that properly in Rust.

Anyway... Don't try to save the file or edit a different file.

It's impossible! hehe
