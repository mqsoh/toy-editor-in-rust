This is a toy text editor that I wrote in Rust, following [Gary Bernhardt's Text Editor From Scratch screencast on Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/text-editor-from-scratch).

I published it as a Docker image if you want to try it, but it's probably more fun to watch the 30 minute screencast!

    docker run -it --rm mqsoh/toy-editor-in-rust
